PlayCode
=========

PlayCode will be a sandbox like JSFiddle, but for personal use and simpler. It will be adaptable to any web server that runs PHP. It will save the snippets in json files at first. You will be able to edit and save, update and view the result of the HTML, CSS and Javascript for the project that you are working on from a single place.

Tech

PlayCode uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [PHP] - [PHP on Git]
* [jQuery] - [jQuery on Git]
* [CodeMirror] - [CodeMirror on Git]

Installation
--------------
We can talk about that whenever the project is ready. For release. What I can say right now is that I am going to do my best for this project to be ready after placing it in a PHP server.
